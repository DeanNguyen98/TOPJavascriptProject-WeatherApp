A simple WeatherApp designed as a part of the Odin Project curriculum. The app retrieves Weather data from WeatherAPI. It enables the users to search for a specific location, and data is displayed in Celsius.

Lessons learned from this project: 

<h1>API Intergration</h1>
- Learned how to integrate with external APIs, specifically WeatherAPI, to fetch real-time weather data.
- Gained experience in handling API requests and responses, including managing API keys and understanding rate limits.
- Developed skills in parsing JSON data returned by the API.
- Implemented logic to extract and display relevant weather information such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
